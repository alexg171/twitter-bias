# Algorithmic Amplification and Content Bias on Twitter/X
### Evidence from the Musk Acquisition — Panel Data & Discrete Choice Models, Spring 2026
**Alex Gamez — The University of Texas at El Paso**

## Research Question

Did Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter (October 27, 2022) causally shift which content categories the platform algorithmically amplifies, relative to what organic user interest would have produced?

## Repo Layout

```
src/    analysis and scraping scripts
data/   raw input files (not committed — see data/README.md)
out/    generated csv/figure outputs (not committed)
docs/   presentation & write-up
```

## Data

Raw inputs live in `data/` (see [data/README.md](data/README.md)); generated outputs land in `out/`.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `data/twitter_trending_4yr.csv` | 694,930 unique topic-day observations, Oct 2020–Oct 2024 |
| `data/reddit_category.tsv` | Daily post counts for 16 matched subreddits, Oct 2020–Oct 2024 |
| `out/unique_topics.csv` | Deduplicated topic list with auto-assigned categories |
| `out/top500_topics_4yr.csv` | Top 500 topics for manual review |
| `out/stata_panel.csv` | Long-format DiD panel (legacy — was fed into Stata's `analysis.do`, since removed) |
| `out/category_did_results.csv` | β₃ coefficients per category |

**Do not commit raw data or output files** — they are listed in `.gitignore`.

---

## Pipeline

Run everything with one command from `src/`:
```
src\run_all.bat
```

| Step | Script | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `twitter_unique.py` | `out/unique_topics.csv`, `out/twitter_category_counts.csv` |
| 2 | `category_analysis.py` | `out/figures/twitter_category_shift.png`, `out/figures/twitter_category_timeseries.png` |
| 3 | `category_did.py` | `out/stata_panel.csv`, `out/category_did_results.csv` |
| 4 | `category_plots.py` | `out/figures/parallel_trends/*.png`, `out/figures/event_study/*.png` |
| 5 | `category_demographics.py` | `out/figures/demographics/*.png` |

> **Note:** the DiD estimation previously ran through a Stata script (`analysis.do`, ~468 lines) which has been removed from the project. `category_did.py` still exports `out/stata_panel.csv` in the same shape, but nothing currently consumes it — the regression itself needs to be reimplemented in Python (e.g. `statsmodels`) if you want to regenerate the β₃ results below from scratch.

---

## Identification Strategy

**Difference-in-Differences (DiD), log-deviation model:**

```
log_dev(y_it) = β0 + β1·Twitter_i + β2·Post_t + β3·(Twitter_i × Post_t) + ε_it
```

- `log_dev(y)` = log(y + c) minus pre-period log mean — puts Twitter and Reddit on the same scale
- `Twitter_i = 1` for Twitter observations, 0 for matched Reddit subreddit
- `Post_t = 1` after October 27, 2022
- `β3` = causal treatment effect in log units; convert to % change as `(e^β3 − 1) × 100`
- HC3 heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors; estimated in Stata via `reghdfe`
- **Control:** one matched Reddit subreddit per category (e.g., r/SquaredCircle for Wrestling)
